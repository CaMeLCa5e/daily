24. Use raw_input() to take two integers from the user (call raw_input() twice). Verify that
they are all numbers; exit() with error if not. Divide one number into the other, and
print the result. Ensure a floating-point result (e.g., 6/4 should be 1.5, not 1).
Expected output:
Please enter first integer: 6
Please enter second integer: 4
6 / 4 = 1.5
Please enter first integer: 6
Please enter second integer: hello
ERROR: part of your input is invalid -- two integers required.
