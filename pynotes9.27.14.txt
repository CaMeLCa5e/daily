Unit Testing and OOP 

State- what makes object unique (what is this information within the object)

Instance level variables - 
class level variables - 

Methods - Behavior or action to interact with data(inst/class variables).
	Way to organize code.
	
class Cat(object)
	def__init__(self, ) 
	
	## every method must start with -(self, )

Dunder = double underscore aka __init__ 

self is a reference to the instance.  
 self.name =  name 
 


Import cat 

cat.cat()

>> takes 4 variables 

	c = cat.Cat('Ruffles', 'Green', 'English')
	
	c.name
	
Functional testing- going through a workflow

integration testing- 

Unit testing- testing small code blocks 

Package- unittest
	testcase 
	testsuite(s) groups of test cases. 
	test runners - run test cases and suites
Test cases are classes. 
	
	
locals()- spits out local namespace. 

python assert function (almost accept... )

Python3- can print a function. 

To turn something into from a module to a package- put in __init__.py
